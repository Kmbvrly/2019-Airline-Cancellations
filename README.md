# 2019-Airline-Cancellations

The task given to our team was to find a large dataset and practice data analysis. We found a dataset containing information about airline delays and cancellations in 2019. This dataset also contained the weather conditions occurring at the time of the delays/cancellations. We decided to form research questions pertaining to any possible correlations within the data. 

Some questions that we were interested in were:
1. Which airline is more prone to delays?
2. Is the age of the departing aircraft correlated to delay?
3. Does the departing airport affect the delay of the carrier?

Using Google Colaboratory for a streamlined operation, we programmed in Python. We utilized pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn to complete our statistical analysis and form data visualizations when needed.
